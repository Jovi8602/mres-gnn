# Data Availability
Several folders are too large to upload to GitHub, but can be downloaded from google drive.

](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bUzDr6qvss4kbZKA-cRYjEh5292Q4ed9?usp=drive_link)

Download and extract the folders so the directory structure looks spmething like this:

project_root/
- dataframes/
- graphs_final/
- 3_Classifier_Code/
- 4_VGAE_Code/
- ...

# Script Usage
All scripts have to be moved from their folders out to the root folder, to utilise dataframes/, results/, graphs\_final/, or saved\_models/.

Directory structure should look something like this: 

project_root/
- dataframes/
- graphs_final/
- saved\_models/
- n_classifier_umap.py
- vgae_sampling.py
- ...


Each subfolder has READMEs of their own to explain what each script does.
